Description: The ERSSA package takes user supplied RNA-seq differential expression 
	dataset and calculates the number of differentially expressed genes at varying 
	biological replicate levels. This allows the user to determine, without relying on
	any a priori assumptions, whether sufficient differential detection has been acheived 
	with their RNA-seq dataset.
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
